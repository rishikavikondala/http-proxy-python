## Overview  

**In the remaining weeks of the quarter, we will create a network service using the Python sockets API. In this lab, we will introduce the basic concepts of network programming with a Sockets API and build a pair of toy applications.**

**Follow the procedures provided to you on Canvas and the course website. When you are finished, answer the following questions and include the completed report in your Pull Request. Be sure to cite any external references that you use.**
